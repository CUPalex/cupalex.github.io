Our preprint on understanding in-context learning in Gemma2-2b is on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00132)! We found a circuit in the model that performs in-context learning and interpreted the information flow in it. See [this X post](https://x.com/abakalova13175/status/1907779187663892755) for a short explanation.
