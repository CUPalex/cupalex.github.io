I am Sasha (short for Aleksandra) Bakalova, Masters student in Language Science and Technology at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) and a Research Assistant at [LaCoCo Lab](https://lacoco-lab.github.io/home/). I did my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/).

I am interested in understanding deep learning models, specifically LLMs. A broad list of topics that I find fascinating is:
- mechanistic interpretability and finding what are the mechanisms that pretrained models use to reach their prediction;
- understanding the difference between architectures used for language modelling, what are their inherent capabilities and limitations;
- describing various phenomena observed in LLMs, such as ability to learn in-context or presence of positional bias and attention sinks.
